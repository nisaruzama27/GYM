<h1>Strength Training</h1>
<p>Strength training isn’t just about building muscle — it’s about building resilience, discipline, and confidence. Every rep is a reminder that you're capable of more than you think. It's not about lifting the heaviest weights from day one, but about showing up, pushing your limits, and getting stronger with each session. The progress might be slow, but the results — both physical and mental — are worth every drop of sweat.</p>

<h1>Body Building</h1>
<p>Bodybuilding is more than a sport — it’s a lifestyle of discipline, dedication, and relentless pursuit of growth. It’s sculpting your physique rep by rep, meal by meal, day after day. Behind every defined muscle is a story of early mornings, clean eating, intense training, and unwavering focus. It’s not just about looking strong — it’s about becoming strong, inside and out.</p>
